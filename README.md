BattleCode 2016 - Team 369 Submission
=====================================

Update: Didn't win anything, but it was fun! Won one out of three of the matches during Qualifying.

How to Use
----------

See https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-scaffold/blob/master/README.md for instructions.
Git init a new folder "team369" into the src directory.

Also saved ClearedAllZombieDens1.rms, the first time I ever cleared all the zombie dens ^_^
But you can also just roll back the history to the appropriate commit and replay it, since BattleCode is deterministic.
